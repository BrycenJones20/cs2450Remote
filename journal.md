Date: 1.22.26 - Subject: Setting up my CS2450 journal

Today I created my local journal.md file and connected it to my personal GitHub repo. 
I learned how to make a commit in git and push it to the remote repository using SSH.
This will allow me to keep a record of my learning throughout the semester.
